    <h1>Arbitrary Plain Text Within XML Using Entity Substitution and CDATA Sections</h1>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      XML is a format for representing data as a nested hierarchy of elements and text. At the top
      level, there is a root element, and within the root element or any child element, there can
      be elements or text, and the text may also contain elements.
    </p><p>
      The start of an element is represented by an opening tag that is an element name surrounded
      by angle brackets (less-than and greater-than characters) and the end of an element is a
      closing tag that is like the opening tag except that it includes a slash following the
      left angle-bracket character.
    </p><p>
      Example: <code>&lt;SomeElement&gt;Some text.&lt;/SomeElement&gt;</code>
    </p><p>
      Additionally, an element with no content may be optionally represented as a self-closing
      element tag. Such a tag has a slash directly preceding the right angle-bracket.
    </p><p>
      Example: <code>&lt;SomeSimpleElement/&gt;</code>
    </p><p>
      Of course, you might want the text content to contain characters with special meaning to XML
      such as the less-than character &ldquo;<samp>&lt;</samp>&rdquo;. XML provides 2 choices of
      mechanism for dealing with that situation: XML entities and CDATA sections.
    </p>

    <h2>XML Entities</h2>
    <p>
      In XML, an entity is designated by a name preceded by an ampersand and followed by a
      semicolon. XML uses specific entites as substitites for characters in text content that
      would otherwise have special meaning in the XML markup. In particular,
      &ldquo;<code>&amp;lt;</code>&rdquo; represents a less-than character
      &ldquo;<samp>&lt;</samp>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<code>&amp;gt;</code>&rdquo; represents a
      greater-than character &ldquo;<samp>&gt;</samp>&rdquo;. Also, since the ampersand represents
      the start of an entity, the ampersand character itself must be represented as an entity,
      which is &ldquo;<code>&amp;amp;</code>&rdquo;.
    </p>

    <h2>CDATA Sections</h2>
    <p>
      In addition to the use of entities, XML supports what are known as a CDATA sections. Each
      CDATA secion begins with &ldquo;<code>&lt;![CDATA[</code>&rdquo; and ends with
      &ldquo;<code>]]&gt;</code>&rdquo;.  All of the text within the CDATA section represents
      itself directly, and no entities need to be used. In fact, entities may not be used because
      anything in the form of an entity will be simply treated as that exact sequence of
      characters. As an example, when contained in a CDATA section,
      &ldquo;<code>&amp;lt;</code>&rdquo; represents the text &ldquo;<samp>&amp;lt;</samp>&rdquo;
      and not the text &ldquo;<samp>&lt;</samp>&rdquo;.
    </p><p>
      The only text that cannot be contained in a CDATA section is the character sequence of
      &ldquo;<code>]]&gt;</code>&rdquo; since that is what is used to indicate the end of the
      CDATA section.
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Example</dt>
      <dd><code>&lt;![CDATA[Example XML: &lt;SelfClosingElementTag/&gt;]]&gt;</code></dd>
      <dt>Represents Text</dt>
      <dd><samp>Example XML: &lt;SelfClosingElementTag/&gt;</samp></dd>
    </dl>
    <p>
      Since entity substitution is available, CDATA is technically unnecessary. CDATA blocks are
      convenient, however, in XML documents that are written or edited directly by humans using
      text editors.
    </p>


    <h2>Processing Instructions and Declarative Statements</h2>
    <p>
      There are some things in XML that are surrounded by angle brackets that are not element
      opening or closing tags. When the next character following the left angle-bracket is a
      letter or a slash &ldquo;<code>/</code>&rdquo;, then it will be part of an element opening
      or closing tag respectively. If, on the other hand, there are question marks just inside of
      the angle brackets &ldquo;<code>&lt;?&hellip;?&gt;</code>&rdquo; then we have a processing
      instruction. If there is an exclamation point following the left angle bracket
      &ldquo;<code>&lt;!&hellip;&gt;</code>&rdquo; then we have a a declarative statement.
    </p><p>
      Processing instructions include such things as XML stylesheet links and XML document
      prologues (the prologue is arguably not exactly a processing instruction but has the same
      form). Declarative statements include such things as XML comments and CDATA sections.
    <dl>
      <dt>XML Prologue Example (follows processing instruction form)</dt>
      <dd><code>&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot; standalone=&quot;yes&quot;?&gt;</code></dd>
      <dt>Comment Block Example (a kind of declarative statement)</dt>
      <dd><code>&lt;!-- This is a comment --&gt;</code></dd>
    </dl>

    <h2>On Generation and Parsing of XML Documents</h2>
    <p>
      The full specification of XML is big and complicated. There are several commonly used,
      standards-compliant code libraries for generating and parsing XML and you should nearly
      always use one of those rather than trying to roll your own XML processing within your
      application. There are far too many ways to get things wrong.
    </p><p>
      There are some limited cases in which you might want to hand-type an XML document, but
      in those cases, you should use an editor that can help you make sure that the XML you are
      typing is at least well-formed.
    </p><p>
      Not rolling your own code to generate XML means not doing <em>anything</em> with raw XML
      content directly in your code. If you do use an XML library and try to handle parts of the
      encoding/decoding directly as well, you will likely end up with the worst of both worlds.
      You might, for instance, construct the text of a valid XML fragment, and then have that
      become encoded as text content when you add it to the document such that it no loses its
      meaning as XML markup. In addition, that code you wrote that appears to generate a valid
      XML fragment likely will not do so in all cases unless you were <em>very</em> thorough
      indeed.
    </p>

    <h2>Code Examples in JavaScript</h2>


    <h3>Example 1</h3>

    <p>
      When text values are encoded into XML, any characters (such as less-than signs) are replaced
      with corresponding XML entities. When parsing the text back out from XML, those entities are
      decoded back into the characters that they represent. It is therefore never a
      <em>requirement</em> to use a CDATA section for text that contains such characters.
    </p>

    <h4>Code</h4>
    <pre id='exampleCode1'></pre>

    <h4>XML Document Output</h4>
    <pre id='exampleOutput1'></pre>

    <h4>Parsed Text From XML Node</h4>
    <pre id='parsedText1'></pre>

    <hr />


    <h3>Example 2</h3>

    <p>
      A CDATA section allows text content containing special characters to be included in XML without
      needing to substitute entities for those characters. This is most useful when the XML document
      needs to be worked with by a human using a text editor.
    </p>

    <h4>Code</h4>
    <pre id='exampleCode2'></pre>

    <h4>XML Document Output</h4>
    <pre id='exampleOutput2'></pre>

    <h4>Parsed Text From XML Node</h4>
    <pre id='parsedText2'></pre>

    <hr />


    <h3>Example 3</h3>

    <p>
      In this example, we create a CDATA fragment in a string, and set that as the content of a text
      node. Since the XML builder is encoding characters for us, the surrounding angle-brackets are
      replaced with entities, and we consequently do <em>not</em> actually have a CDATA section.
      What we <em>do</em> have is a text node that contains a representation of what happens to be
      an XML code fragment for a CDATA section. When that is parsed again, the parser does not know or
      care that the content happens to represent the XML code for CDATA, and we get back the entire
      CDATA representation as the text content of the element.
    </p><p>
      Again, since this is not <em>actually</em> a CDATA section, the less-than characters and the
      ampersand within the text are also replaced by entities. If that were <em>not</em> the case,
      then this would be malformed XML that could not be parsed.
